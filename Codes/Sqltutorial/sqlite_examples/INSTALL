You should be able to run make

   $ make

If you run into problems, make sure the next two conditions
are satisfied.

  1. sqlite3 must be installed. 

      $ wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-3.0.8.tar.gz
      $ tar -xzf sqlite-3.0.8.tar.gz
      $ cd sqlite-3.0.8
      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ make install

  2. For all examples to work, you should be using gclib, since
     getline is used in the program. However, some of the programs
     will still compile without this.
